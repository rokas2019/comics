<h6 class="post-title">BREAKING: Sony and Marvel Studios Reach Deal For One Last Spidey Movie</h6>
<ul class="post-meta clearfix no-sep"><li class="post-date"><span class="fa fa-clock-o"></span>September 27, 2019</li><li class="post-author"><span class="fa fa-user"></span><a href="https://mcuexchange.com/author/aeroneclarinal/" rel="author">Aeron Eclarinal</a></li></ul>

<div><img class="center-align" src="images/imgnews.jpg"></div>
<div><p>In an interview with THR, Head of Marvel Studios, Kevin Feige, shared the exciting news.</p>

<p>I am thrilled that Spidey’s journey in the MCU will continue, and I and all of us at Marvel Studios are very excited that we get to keep working on it. Spider-Man is a powerful icon and hero whose story crosses all ages and audiences around the globe. </p>

<p>Feige also mentioned that Spider-Man is the only Marvel hero that would cross “cinematic universes” with him referencing Sony’s own Spidey-verse, as he also teases “surprises” in the future. The release date of the untitled third Spider-Man MCU movie is set on July 16, 2021.</p>

<p>An additional report from Comicbook.com states that the main cast from the first two MCU Spidey flicks will be back for the third movie, which is led by Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Jon Favreau. It is also being reported that Feige will also be producing the film along with Sony Chair, Amy Pascal. Jon Watts is also on board to return to the Director’s chair for the third movie.</p>

<p>Thankfully this means we will get a resolution to that massive cliffhanger ending from Spider-Man Far: From Home, where Peter’s identity is revealed courtesy of J. Jonah Jameson. The report also mentioned that this will not be the last adventure for Tom Holland as Spider-Man. The deal also includes his appearance in an additional MCU film and THR does hint at a new deal for further films being a very real possibility.</p>

<p>This is certainly a welcome development for fans and it signifies that negotiations are still happening behind the scenes. The reference of Sony’s Spidey-verse from Feige is very telling and we can expect that there will be more announcements for the web-slinging hero in the future.</p>

<h6 class="post-title">Jon Watts In Final Negotiations to Return for Third 'Spider-Man'</h6>

<p>What a day for the Marvel Cinematic Universe! After an incredibly rocky few weeks between Marvel Studios and Sony, news broke earlier today that Spider-Man will return to the MCU for at least one more solo movie, completing his well-deserved MCU trilogy. Now, an update to the report from Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that director Jon Watts is in final negotiations to direct the third film! Terms of the deal were not released, but this will make Watts only the second director in the MCU to have his own trilogy, joining James Gunn and the Guardians of the Galaxy saga.
</p>
<p>
Today has been a day of pure joy and celebration with the wall-crawler coming back to complete his solo adventures, especially considering the cliffhanger we were all left with at the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home. With Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal both coming back to produce the film, along with Tom Holland and all of his classmates set to return to New York and finish off their high school careers. This film will be the 4th film of 2021 releasing on July 16th and is now the 7th film of Marvel’s phase 4. Needless to say, the excitement is through the roof as we celebrate the return of our friendly neighborhood MCU Spider-Man!

<h6 class="post-title">'Helstrom' Adds Director Daina Reid</h6>

<p>It has been quite a rollercoaster for Marvel TV today. Right after rumors surface that Kevin Feige wants to establish his own version of Ghost Rider, the Hulu-developed series featuring the return of Gabriel Luna as Robbie Reyes gets passed on. This would’ve kickstarted an additional crossover series for Marvel TV similar to Netflix’s The Defenders and the upcoming animated series The Offenders. It has gotten a bit difficult to keep an overview of all the projects that Marvel TV is working on, especially with Marvel Studios branching out into serialized storytelling with Disney+. Looks like at least one of the announce live-action Hulu series is still moving forward, as according to HN Entertainment Daina Reid will direct some episodes of the upcoming Helstrom series.
</p>
<p>She is joining showrunner Paul Zbyszewsky and stunt coordinator Larry Lam to bring Daimon Helstrom to life on Hulu. This show would’ve joined Ghost Rider as part of their Adventures of Fear crossover but at least this show still seems to be moving forward, as its working title Omens was just recently revealed as well. There is still a chance that Ghost Rider may make an appearance in the show or a future crossover mini-series. Helstrom will take some liberties with the original but it seems to be giving the supernatural franchise a mystery element with Daimon’s father being a serial killer.
</p>
<p>
Australian director Reid has been building up quite a reputation with Hulu. She is Emmy nominated for her work on Hulu’s standout show The Handmaid’s Tale. Her colleague Kari Skogland is also part of the Marvel family, as she is set to direct the six episodes of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. We might see many more talents from Hulu’s series joining the Marvel fray in other series as the franchise keeps expanding.

Are you excited for Helstrom?

<h6 class="post-title">Birds of Prey Takes Wing in its Fabulous First Poster</h6>
<p>The Birds of Prey are “heading” out!</p>
<p>
We’ve been hit with so much DC movie news of late, it’s a wonder we’re not all seeing stars. If you are, it’s hopefully a result of our recent casting news and not an actual, physical injury. Still, Harley Quinn’s here to ensure that if there do happen to be any objects orbiting around your head, they’re birds.</p>

<p>Yes, birds. As in Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn, the upcoming DC movie in which Margot Robbie returns to the role that made her a DC Extended Universe star. The 2020 film released its first poster today, which features a dazed looking Quinn surrounded by small, winged versions of the movie’s cast. It’s a fun, colorful concept that reminds us that when it comes to getting stuff done, Harley Quinn’s always preferred to wing it.</p>

<div class="responsive-image">
			<img class="center-align"  src="images/birdsnews.jpg">
</div>
<p>
	Roll call! Circling Harley’s noggin from left to right is Rosie Perez as Renee Montoya, Chris Messina as Victor Zsasz, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Huntress, Ewan McGregor as Black Mask, Robbie as Harley, Jurnee Smollett-Bell as Black Canary and Ella Jay Basco as Cassandra Cain. </p>
<p>
Along with the poster, Birds of Prey also launched their social channels, so be sure to follow them on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for all of the latest news, images and trailers from the eagerly awaited movie. Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn lands in theaters February 7, 2020. In the meantime, let us know what you think of the poster…and what your favorite bird is! (We’re big fans of Robins over here, but that’s kind of to be expected.)

<h6 class="post-title">How to Binge DC Super Hero Girls in One Metropolis-Sized Marathon</h6>
<p>Green Lantern versus Star Sapphire. Wonder Woman versus Cheetah. Batgirl versus…her part-time job?! The classic DC characters and matchups you’ve always loved from the comics are reimagined with plenty of style and laughs on DC Super Hero Girls! And now that the Cartoon Network series is on Netflix in the US, you can binge to your heart’s content—with a couple of tips from the show’s executive producer, Lauren Faust.</p>
<p>DC Super Hero Girls is an animated show that puts a teenaged twist on some of your favorite DC heroes and villains. It’s got superpowers. It’s got super action. And it’s got some super sass. All together that combines into one fun-filled series that you can watch with the kids for an unforgettable night of family TV.</p>
<div class="responsive-image">
			<img class="center-align"  src="images/imggnews.jpg">
</div>
<p>As the series begins, young Barbara Gordon begrudgingly moves to Metropolis at the request of her father. She’s left behind her entire life and friends in Gotham City, including one Harleen Quinzel. Barbara notices right away that not everything is as it seems at Metropolis High—she is a world-class detective, after all. She follows her instincts and uses her wits to gather together a group of special young women: the shy Karen Beecher (Bumblebee); the peace-loving Jessica Cruz (Green Lantern); the mysterious and magical Zee Zatara (Zatanna); the rebellious Kara Danvers (Supergirl); and the fish-out-of-water Diana Prince (Wonder Woman).</p>


<p>
	Together the girls face their foes and their flaws head-on to become the team that Metropolis needs. (Superman can’t do it all on his own!) While the girls do fly high, that doesn’t mean they’re above having some fun. Every episode comes with a fair bit of snark and attitude—especially from Kara, in a nice nod to her quick temper in the comics—and it’s just the right amount of irreverence and vulnerability that makes the girls feel like real teens with real problems.</p>
<p>
	<div class="responsive-image">
			<img class="center-align"  src="images/imgnews2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Barbara might be brilliant, but she’s also easily distracted, Karen feels small and weak, and Kara hates that her famous cousin gets all the credit she deserves as well. They each need a little help from their friends to learn how to overcome their shortcomings. Oh, and I did I mention the super baddies they have to face at the same time? Battles against Giganta, Livewire, Cheetah and more give us the action-packed heroics that we all love to see from our favorite DC characters, no matter how old they are. Yet, as great as the villains are, the real adversaries the heroes have to face over the course of the series are likely to be much more familiar to school-aged viewers.</p>
<p>
	In a typical example, when Livewire purposely uses social media to embarrass the hapless heroes and their friends, it’s shocking how quickly the crowd turns on the previously-adored crew. Yet, it’s something that any child or teen who’s had experience with online bullying will recognize right away…along with the girls’ initial helplessness at confronting it. A faceless, mocking crowd feels much scarier than a garishly dressed villain with sparking electricity powers. It’s only when the girls make a stand against the bully together that they can face their fears with bravery. Even if you think you can handle whatever life (or Catwoman) throws at you all by yourself, DC Super Hero Girls proves that having your best friends at your back can make all the difference in the world.
</p>

<p>
	DC Super Hero Girls mixes humor and slapstick with heart and superpowers to show kids and remind grownups that heroes come in all shapes and sizes. And now that it’s on Netflix, you can binge it all in one powerfully entertaining night! Lauren Faust even stopped by Twitter recently to give followers the scoop on which order to watch the episodes in.  

“Episode 12 should be episode 5,” suggests Faust, “and hold off on episode 9 until after the next batch.”

Let’s hope that next batch of exciting episodes gets here faster than the Flash, because we can’t wait to see what happens to the super friends next.
 

The first thirteen episodes of DC Super Hero Girls are now available to stream on Netflix in the US.
