          Have you ever looked at your old high school yearbook and wanted to bury it somewhere, or do you wish you could run and hide when a really embarrassing memory shows up on your Timehop? We all have those humiliating moments and the Batman family is no exception. When you’ve been around for 80 years there’s bound to be a bit of cringe along the way. Not every story can be The Dark Knight Returns or Hush, sometimes you get “Batman Becomes Bat-Baby.” This Batman Day, let’s celebrate and honor the Dark Knight the same way we do with all of our best friends—by telling embarrassing stories about their past! Here are a few of the less stellar moments he and his allies have had throughout their rich and diverse history.

        <p>For 80 years, the Dark Knight has stood as a symbol of determination, bravery and justice to generations of fans. Since appearing in the pages of DETECTIVE COMICS #27 on March 30, 1939, Batman continues to leave his mark in every form of entertainment imaginable. Appearing in countless comics, animation, television, films, video games, toys and other products, he remains the single most popular superhero. He would not be complete without the most iconic gadgets and of course, the Batmobile; not to mention, an unparalleled rogues gallery.

          Batman is humanity’s timeless hero and he’s just getting started.

        Join us for a year-long global celebration of the Caped Crusader! #LongLiveTheBat #Batman80 #Detective1000</p>
        <p>Batman Day is almost here and to celebrate the Dark Knight’s 80 years as the World’s Greatest Detective, DC and Warner Bros. are lighting up the night skies by projecting the iconic Bat-Signal, as well as producing fan celebrations, in major cities around the globe on Saturday, September 21.

        <p>Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive… <br>
         From his blue uniform to his flowing red cape to the "S" shield on his chest, Superman is one of the most immediately recognizable and beloved DC Super Heroes of all time. The Man of Steel is the ultimate symbol of truth, justice, and hope. He is the world's first Super Hero and a guiding light to all.

        Though his hands might always be a little bit wet (it's because he just washed them), we still can't get enough of Peter Porker from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.
