          Have you ever looked at your old high school yearbook and wanted to bury it somewhere, or do you wish you could run and hide when a really embarrassing memory shows up on your Timehop? We all have those humiliating moments and the Batman family is no exception. When you’ve been around for 80 years there’s bound to be a bit of cringe along the way. Not every story can be The Dark Knight Returns or Hush, sometimes you get “Batman Becomes Bat-Baby.” This Batman Day, let’s celebrate and honor the Dark Knight the same way we do with all of our best friends—by telling embarrassing stories about their past! Here are a few of the less stellar moments he and his allies have had throughout their rich and diverse history.

      <p class="batman">For 80 years, the Dark Knight has stood as a symbol of determination, bravery and justice to generations of fans. Since appearing in the pages of DETECTIVE COMICS #27 on March 30, 1939, Batman continues to leave his mark in every form of entertainment imaginable. Appearing in countless comics, animation, television, films, video games, toys and other products, he remains the single most popular superhero. He would not be complete without the most iconic gadgets and of course, the Batmobile; not to mention, an unparalleled rogues gallery.

        Batman is humanity’s timeless hero and he’s just getting started.

      Join us for a year-long global celebration of the Caped Crusader! #LongLiveTheBat #Batman80 #Detective1000</p>

      <p>Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive… <br>
       From his blue uniform to his flowing red cape to the "S" shield on his chest, Superman is one of the most immediately recognizable and beloved DC Super Heroes of all time. The Man of Steel is the ultimate symbol of truth, justice, and hope. He is the world's first Super Hero and a guiding light to all.

    The writer the newest Batman/Superman comic series promised it would be one of DC's biggest and most important stories in years, and the latest twist may show exactly why. Readers beware: massive SPOILERS ahead.

    When The Batman Who Laughs invaded the DC Universe to show what Bruce Wayne would become if he surrendered to Joker's madness, fans knew the nightmarish supervillain was something new. Now his master plan has been revealed, having infected six DC heroes with the evil of the Dark Multiverse. That's the kind of trust-testing mystery only Batman and Superman could ever solve. But the duo have just accepted their next step isn't to fight their enemy... it's to sacrifice the Man of Steel himself to an infection of evil.

    <p>New Peter Porker Short Has Spider-Ham Fighting Super Villains and Eating Hot Dogs<br>
      Though his hands might always be a little bit wet (it's because he just washed them), we still can't get enough of Peter Porker from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.

    <p>
    “After December 14, we will live in a world where everyone knows Peter Porker,” says comics writer Dan Slott. “Laymen on the street. Kids with their lunch boxes and onesies. Everyone is gonna know who Spider-Ham is.” He pauses. He laughs at the ridiculousness of it all. “What a world.”</p>
    <p>
      No, those aren’t typos. Slott is not talking about Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man. He’s talking about Peter Porker, the Spectacular Spider-Ham. The former is one of the best-known characters ever to appear in fiction, a man granted amazing powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. The latter is a relentlessly bizarre offshoot, a spider who gains his own abilities after being bitten by a radioactive pig. For decades, he slung webs in obscurity as a Z-list Marvel Comics character. That’s all about to change. This Friday, Spider-Ham makes his improbable big-screen debut in the critically acclaimed animated feature Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, in which various alternate-dimension versions of Spidey team up to fight for justice. Porker is easily the strangest of the group, and the story of his rise to prominence is just as strange.
